CPT 114, Test Two Fall 2013

You must provide the following:
Problem Statement (human algorithm is not required)
Flowchart (using Visual Logic to create and .emf file)
An html file with your java script code.

Problem :  You have been hired by the local county fair stand to write a program that will allow them to keep track of the sale of their grilled goods.  The grilled goods section sells types of hamburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs and nachos.  Hamburgers are $4, hot dogs are $2, Corn dogs are $3 and nachos are $5.00.  (Important:  Your program is keeping a running total of each item, the person using this isn't adding them up and just giving you the total at the end of the day).  At the end of the day a report is provided that will show something similar to the following example information (the numbers here just represent “test” data, any number of Hamburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs and nachos can be sold):

The total number of hotdog purchased: 20  
The total number of hamburgers purchased: 10 
The total number of corndogs purchased: 15  
The total number of nachos purchased: 10 
The total dollar amount for hotdog: $40.00
The total dollar amount for hamburger: $40.00
The total dollar amount for corndogs: $45.00
The total dollar amount for nachos: $50.00
The total amount of money collected: $175.00 

The above output was generated by the following test data purchases in this exact order:

hotdogs-10,  nachos-5,  hot dog-5 ,  hamburgers-3,  hot dogs-5, hamburgers-7, corn dogs-6, corn dogs-9, and  nachos-5. 

You can use the above as test data for you to test your flowchart and javascript program. Your program should be able to take in any amount of different types of grilled items, in any order, and come out with the totals (Hint:  you must use a loop, only 1, unlike assignment 7 you are not accumulating text,  just numbers).
Upload all the files (problem statement, flowchart, and code) to the Test 2 dropbox.
